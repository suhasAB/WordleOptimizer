# We have to combine Entropy with Relative word frequency probabiliy to evaluate the best. 
# To find the Frequency of English words,we use Google books common words frequency evaluation dataset available at http://norvig.com/google-books-common-words.txt. This list contains words of all charecter lenghts. We have filtered out 5 letter words using below code and maps them in a tuple pair,with decreasing order of relative frequency.
